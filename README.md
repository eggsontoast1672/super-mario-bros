# Mario Throwaway

I've been bouncing around between some different languages and graphics
libraries recently, but I've had some sort of gripe with all of them. Rust
doesn't have a mature enough ecosystem, Python doesn't have static typing,
Java doesn't have any lightweight build tools available, C++ is too
nonsensical, et cetera.

I decided to just hunker down with C and see how things go. Good old Simple
Direct Media Layer has never done me any wrong.

A good project would be to try and recreate Super Mario Bros. So that's what
this is. The MIT License is par for the course as far as my other projects are
concerned, so do whatever with my code. It's not really the best anyway, so if
you use it in your projects, you're probably hurting yourself.

## To-do's

- Move player-related stuff into `player.c`
